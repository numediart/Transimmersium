Project Partners Complementarity:

The two operators complement each other very well: the IMT Lille-Douai conducts research in Intelligent Transport to model the behavior of "vulnerable users" in dangerous situations. UMONS has unique expertise in "attention analysis in an immersive environment" using 3D models with distractors or a restricted field of vision to simulate age-related problems.
